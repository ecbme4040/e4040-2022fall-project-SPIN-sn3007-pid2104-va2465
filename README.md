# ECBM E4040 Final Project - A Reimplementation of the 'Swin' Transformer using Tensorflow 2.x

This repo contains the code for a Tensorflow 2.x implementation of the Swin Transformer from the paper [Swin Transformer: Hierarchical Vision Transformer using Shifted Windows](https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.14030). Additionally, the transformer model is evaluated on the CIFAR-10 Image Classification Dataset.
